# A Simple Password Generator

This small hobby project I made on a whim in a few minutes randomly generates a 20-character-long hexadecimal password. Will it be easy to remember? Hell no! Is it secure? It's probably better than your password being "password" but I used Math.random() so it's likely not cryptographically sound.
